I have use the standard code provided and have added the methods setUpSmooth(), SmoothRough(), get1RingSize(), getNeighbours(). All of them are in the file GeometricSurfaceDirectedEdge.cpp

Also, I have made modifications to the file GeometricController.cpp to be able to modify the code for the slider to work as intended having two different sliders and a button. The first slider modify the laplacian parameter, how much will it moves towards the centroid, the second slider modify the number of iterations, how many times it will move the vertices. Finally, the button makes the mesh to become smoother with the parameters or rougher.

Compile:

To compile execute ./compile.sh it is a file I created to execute all the commands to compile

To execute the compiled files use: ./nameFolder ./diredgenormals/fileName.diredgenormal
